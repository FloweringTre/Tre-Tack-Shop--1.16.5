# Notice about 1.16.5 - (3.20.2024)
This is a broken and incomplete build. While the modding environment builds just fine without any mods installed on it, it will not build or run with the required SWEM mods to start integration with it. 

This has been posted here for anyone to fork and try to make it work. It has all the required codes, builds, assets, files, etc. needed to bring the V2.0.5 Tack Shop to 1.16.5 if it can be fixed. This is an open source code project and anyone can fork this to try and fix it. **All I ask is that you give credit to me for the coding and my texture artist team for the textures if you do take this project on and finish it**

My discord DMs are open if you want to talk about this and work through the problems together. :)

# Tre's Tack Shop
An addon mod to SWEM that expands the number of tack items in the game for the community to use to add new textures to the game without overriding the original tack items. It also includes ribbons and trophy models from the original SWEM mod in order to produce ribbons and trophies that can be displayed as the creators intended them to be but now in an item frame instead of a placeable block, thus keeping the name/NBT data of the item.

***Over 1,000 new tack items added!***

### *Now featuring crafting recipes!*
This mod started as just a place for resource artists to stash new textures on; but now it includes fully rendered and designed tack in all types including some new ones! It also now includes survival crafting recipes for those items as a 'Tack Set' and also has an uncraftable 'Award Set' so servers can have custom tack items for their server that are uncraftable by players.

Also include new models of my own design as I make them. -- currently added a cute pumpkin trophy, drill team flags, and 'wearable' medals! Also includes models that Moon Flower makes such as the Snowflake trophy, the bitless/bareback tack and the quarter sheets!

### Thank you to our helpers!
All rendered (appearing on the SWEM horses) 'Rainbow' Tack items are textures made by Moon Flower. [Click here to see their links!](https://moon-flower-info.carrd.co )

The Tack Boxes, Ribbons, and Rosette textures along with the standard Trophy textures are made by RileyCasper. [Click here to join their discord!](https://discord.gg/cZ6bVAuuJj)

Thank you to AIDEN for your help making 1.16.5 start to come together!

### Note to resources pack makers
All tack items have two textures attached to them, the texture on the horse and the icon in the menus/inventory. To change rendered horse textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***swem*** assets folder. To change the icon textures, you must replace the numbered .png file in the ***tretackshop*** assets folder.

**A template texture pack that includes instructions in a read-me file along with all of this mod's template textures is shared in our discord**

### Note to Modpack makers
Feel free to add to your pack! Please ensure that SWEM and its dependencies are included. If your pack is for 1.20.1, please double check your SWEM version as sometimes it auto-generates with the wrong SWEM version.
